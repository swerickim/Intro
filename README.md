Hi! My name is Sangwon Kim and I go by Sam. I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Statistics with an emphasis on computational statistics and Data Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I'm deeply interested in data science & business analytics. This GitHub contains several different data projects that I have done. I'm still working on other data projects and trying to upload them on a regular basis. Hope you enjoy my work! (Scroll down to check my pinned repos.)
